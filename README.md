# ObjDetect
Maintaing Social Distancing Using ObjDetection

Using ImageAI, OpenCV and Matplotlib to detect people in a space, this script uses eucledian distance between centroids
to establish a social distancing threshold. Using the centroid points and data we create graphs showing centroid 
movement and interaction, and use OpenCV VideoWriter to create a 'movie' of centroid movements from matplotlib graphs. 

An interesting project that can be used to monitor public spaces as well as study the movement of germs and diseases within
a concentrated space.
